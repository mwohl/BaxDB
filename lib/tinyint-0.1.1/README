tinyint-postgresql

This is an extension that impelements tinyint (1 byte integer) as a data type
of PostgreSQL. Traditionally, PostgreSQL core has a policy not to have 1 byte
integer in it. With this module, you can define 1 byte integer column on your
tables, which will help query performances and portabilities from other RDBMS.
